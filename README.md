## Hello Readers,
## FOSSEE 2025: Analysing simply supported Beam under moving load conditions
This is a project to analyse a simply supported beam under moving load. I am writing this program for the screening round of FOSSEE 2025.
Approach used:
1. Take input parameters for the beam(L) and the load details w1,w2,x.
2. Calculate max reacn at A and B using ILD approach.
3. Calculate max SF and max BM and display the results.
#### Thankyou.
