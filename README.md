Hello Readers,
This is a project to analyse a simply supported beam under moving load. I am writing this program for the screening round of FOSSEE 2025.
Approach used:
  1.Take beam parameters and load info.
  2.Calculate max reacn at A and B using ILD approach.
  3.Calculate max SF and max BM and display the results.
Thankyou.
